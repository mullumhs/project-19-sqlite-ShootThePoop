# HTML Basics Project

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains two HTML tasks for the MHS Software Engineering class. This project focuses on creating basic HTML pages, introducing students to fundamental HTML concepts and structure. Students will learn about HTML tags, semantic elements, tables, and forms.

## Task 1: Basic HTML Page
- File: `task1.html`
- Description: Create a basic HTML page that includes a main heading, a picture with a subheading, and a list of links. This task covers:
  - Basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
  - Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
  - Images (`<img>`)
  - Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
  - Links (`<a>`)

## Task 2: Contact Form
- File: `task2.html`
- Description: Create a more complex HTML page with a team profile table and a contact form. This task covers:
  - Semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
  - Tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`)
  - Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`)
  - Radio buttons and labels
